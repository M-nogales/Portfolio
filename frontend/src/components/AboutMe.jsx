        Hello, my name is Manuel Nogales Serrano, but everyone calls me <strong className="text-accentColor">Manu</strong>.
        I&apos;ve been a programmer since I was <strong className="text-accentColor">16 years old</strong>, thanks to my
        teacher, Paco, who introduced me to the basics of programming. Under his
        guidance, I created my first website dedicated to the band
        &quot;Extremoduro&quot;.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base font-normal leading-6 text-textForeground">
        Currently, I hold a <strong className="text-accentColor">Higher Technician degree in Web Development</strong>, and I
        am eager to demonstrate my skills in a professional setting.
